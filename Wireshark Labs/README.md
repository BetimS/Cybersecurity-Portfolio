# Wireshark-Labs

This project demonstrates my understanding of HTTP protocols, focusing on the analysis of basic and conditional GET requests. The assignment involved inspecting browser-server interactions, interpreting HTTP headers, and analyzing status codes for efficient resource handling.

## Objective
The objective of this project was to:

- Analyze basic HTTP GET/response interactions between a browser and a server.

- Explore and understand the HTTP Conditional GET mechanism.

- Interpret HTTP request and response headers, including status codes, to understand server behavior.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Understanding HTTP communication, including basic and conditional GET methods.

- Analyzing request and response headers for key insights.

- Identifying and interpreting HTTP status codes (200 OK and 304 Not Modified).

- Practical application of conditional requests to optimize server resource usage.

## Tools Used
- <u>Browser Developer Tools:</u> Used to inspect HTTP requests and responses.

- <u>Wireshark:</u> Employed for capturing and analyzing HTTP traffic.

- <u>Server Environment:</u> Interaction with the gaia.cs.umass.edu server.


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze and interpret HTTP communication, including the practical benefits of conditional requests. It emphasizes efficient use of server resources and highlights my technical skills in network protocol analysis.
