# SQL-Filter-Queries

# SQL Filter Queries: Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate
This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL by showcasing filter queries for analyzing and managing data. As part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, this assignment focuses on using SQL to extract, filter, and manipulate data relevant to cybersecurity scenarios.

# Objective
The primary goal of this project was to create and execute SQL queries that:
Extract specific subsets of data from large datasets.
Use filtering conditions to identify and flag potential anomalies.
Support cybersecurity monitoring, threat analysis, and decision-making.

# Key Features
Data Filtering: Applied WHERE clauses to retrieve data based on specific conditions such as user roles, IP ranges, or login timestamps.
Aggregation and Sorting: Used functions like GROUP BY and ORDER BY to identify patterns or rank data by priority.
Complex Queries: Combined multiple filtering conditions with logical operators (AND, OR) to fine-tune results.
Anomaly Detection: Implemented queries to identify failed login attempts, excessive access requests, or unusual activity.

# Skills Demonstrated
SQL query writing and optimization.
Database management and data analysis.
Data filtering techniques for cybersecurity applications.
Identification of patterns in large datasets for security monitoring.

# Tools Used
Database Management Systems: MySQL
Development Environment: [Insert your environment, e.g., MySQL Workbench, VSCode with a SQL plugin]
Data Source: [Include the dataset details if not confidential, e.g., simulated login data or anonymized log files.]
Sample Query

# Conclusion
This project highlights my ability to use SQL for data filtering and cybersecurity analysis, emphasizing practical problem-solving skills for real-world scenarios.
